The MP Tweet List allows you to easily display your most recent tweets, with support for multiple Twitter accounts - with no Javascript or Flash.

== Description ==

The MP Tweet List allows you to easily display your most recent tweets, with *support for multiple Twitter accounts* - with *no Javascript or Flash*.

This plugin will add a widget that can be used in any widgetized area in your theme. It is fully customizable, allowing you to choose the widget title, how many tweets to display and which user's tweets to display. It also allows you to choose whether or not to convert @mentions, #hashtags and links independent of eachother.

This plugin supports up to two Twitter users at the same time. Many blogs and websites have multiple authors and you may want to display two users' tweets that is where the MP Tweet List comes in handy. If you only want to display one Twitter user, simply leave the second user field blank.

The widget does not require any javascript or external files to work. It generates pure HTML lists.

**NOTE:** Your Twitter account cannot be set to Private.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display x number of tweets from user1 and y number of tweets from user2? =
At the moment, no. This plugin will evenly distribute the number of tweets displayed. For example, if 10 is selected - user1 will show 5 tweets and user2 will show 5 tweets. If 9 is selected - user1 will show 4 tweets and user2 will show 4 tweets. Contact Mike@MikesPickzWS.com to request this.
