Portfolio allows you to create a page with information about your past projects.

== Description ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload `portfolio` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you have a 'loop.php' file in your WordPress template then place this strings `<?php global $wp_query; if ( $wp_query->query_vars['tag'] ) { 
if(function_exists('display_term')) { display_term(); return; } } ?>` in your templates before string `<?php if ( ! have_posts() ) : ?>`or `<?php if ( have_posts() ) : ?>`.
4. Please check if you have the 'portfolio.php' template file in your templates directory. If you are not able to find this file, then just copy it from '/wp-content/plugins/portfolio/template/' directory to your templates directory.
